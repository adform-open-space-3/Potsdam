    "Track": "1",
    "Summary": "When we introduced Scrum (one of Agile project management methods) in Lavasoft (Sweden), it allowed to put order to chaotic development process. The released version was with much better quality and more features compared to previous ones. When I was describing this project management method to my cousin, IT project manager in Lithuania, he was smiling. “It will never work in Lithuania, with our people” – was his conclusion. I never believed this. I came back to Lithuania. In 2009 we implemented and we are successfully using Scrum in Adform since. It was clear evidence – employees in Lithuania do not differ from the rest of the world. Project management methods that work abroad are well applicable in Lithuania as well.\n\nIn 2010, while organizing first Agile conference in Lithuania – Agile Tour Vilnius 2010 (http://2010.agileturas.lt) – we had trouble finding Lithuanian speakers who would have Agile experience in Lithuania. Nevertheless, we found few, and this conference became the birth for community of Agile practitioners. This community actively promotes Agile in Lithuania by sharing their experiences in different events.\n\nSo what is Agile project management? Why some project managers, managers or CEOs still think that these methods are not applicable in Lithuania, in their projects, companies? Which companies are using Agile and what benefits they claim to get (or not to get)? In this presentation I will share my experience implementing and using Scrum. I will also share my insights how, where, and why Agile project management methods are spreading in Lithuania.",

Where does this lead?\n\nStagnation of Management - is the name for the period that we have seen over the past few decades in various industries, and especially in the software development.\n\nHow not to lead a company into a dead end? How to get out of stagnation? How do successful enterprises organize their management structures?\n\nToday, we can see the revival of management. Lean, Agile, Scrum - these philosophies and approaches give us the impetus to the transformation and development of the latent potential of our companies, projects, teams, and employees.\n\nBut are we able to correctly perceive and use these advices?\n\nIn this talk, you will hear the epic of the highly successful corporation, from which only ruins remained. You'll learn about the two types of managers: the professor and entrepreneur. You will be introduced to the three areas of management and know that there are much more managers in your company than your HR department thinks.\n\nYou will discover a world of new management - the path of personal development and corporate renaissance.",

    "Summary": "The needs to go faster to market and cut costs, dominating theindustry lately, are significantly changing the landscape of softwarequality. Many pillars of successful quality strategies in the past arejust slowing down delivery too much.
